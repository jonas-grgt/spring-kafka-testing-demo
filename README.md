# Testing a sping-kafka based application

This small demo application accompanies my post on testing a Spring-Kafka based application.

## Usage

Requires Java 21.

To run the tests, you can use the following Maven command:

```shell
mvn clean verify
```

This will also make sure that the necessary AVRO schemas are generated.
